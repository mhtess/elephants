|         1| English  | 0         | 27  | Female | On an early question (question 4, maybe?) there was one property that said  during the question instead of a property to consider. I marked % for this question. | I don&quotechart know if it was intentional, or part of the experiment, but reading the stories in segments as they were presented, with such large letters, made them kind of difficult to parse? Having the whole story on one page would have helped my memory of the facts better, I think. But again: maybe that was part of the experiment. :) |

Attention check
---------------

### Slider practice

Before the experiment, participants practice usign the sliders to rate 3 category--property pairs:

-   dogs bark (coded as correct if x &gt; 0.5)
-   birds are male (coded as correct if 0.25 &lt; x &lt; 0.75)
-   cats get cancer (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.50)

### Memory check

After the story, participants select statements they recall learning from a list of 10 generic statements about novel animals (5 true, 5 distractor). They are also asked to explain what they did in the experiment.

| property        |  sum(correct)|

| birds are male  |            26|
| cats get cancer |            25|
| dogs bark       |            27|
| lions lay eggs  |            24|

|        23| Learned various things about this alien world, including some bits of culture and a lot of things about the wildlife.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|        24| When thorough and alien book and read about their planet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|        25| I selected my percentage to certain events happening in the chapters that related to the story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|        26| I am not a person who does well learning mundane facts that have little meaning or future use. Never have in school and even now i&quotecharve forgotten everything. Its hard to relate to thing that don&quotechart have an image and simply stating something has wings or something, it doesn&quotechart really associate the names to anything that sits in my working memory. |

Trial data
----------

Removing participants who got fewer than 7 correct on memory check.

participant responses
---------------------

collapsed across trials

-   fill = number of correct responses on the memory check (out of 10)
-   facet = particiapnts

filler trials
-------------

these used quantifiers (and thus we have strong idea about literal meaning)
