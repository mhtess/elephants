## Trial data

Removing participants who got fewer than 7 correct on memory check.

## participant responses

collapsed across trials

  - fill = number of correct responses on the memory check (out of 10)
  - facet = particiapnts

## filler trials

two of these used quantifiers (and thus we have strong idea about
literal meaning) - “all aliens love Zorxon” - “no storms (or few) on Dax
result in permanent damage…”

other two are generics about singular properties
