Shows how much interpretation is a part of how we understand a sentence. I found myself having some trouble determining if the sentences were saying all or not. For example, if you say fish live in rivers and lakes, are you saying they only live in rivers and lakes, or they can live in rivers and lakes? Some context is missing and the reader has to fill it in. Very interesting. Good luck with your research. |

Attention Checks
----------------

### Slider Practice

Before the experiment, participants practice using the sliders to rate 3 sentences:

-   There are ten continents on Earth. (coded as correct if response == false)
-   Firefighters work on boats. (coded as correct if response == false)
-   The sun rises in the east. (coded as correct if response == true)

|  n\_correct|    n|
|-----------:|----:|
|           0|    1|
|           1|    3|
|           2|   24|
|           3|   80|

| sentence                           |  n\_correct|
|:-----------------------------------|-----------:|
| Firefighters work on boats.        |          95|
| The sun rises in the east.         |          98|
| There are ten continents on Earth. |          98|

### Memory Check

After the story, participants select statements they recall seeing from a list of 10 (5 true, 5 distractor).

### Explanations of Task

After the story, participants are also asked to explain generally what they did in the experiment.
