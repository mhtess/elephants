[Link to experiment](http://www.mit.edu/~tessler/projects/elephants/experiments/elephants-1.html)

Participants read a storybook about an alien planet. Each chapter consists of some description of a kind, for example, elephants. The participants are either asked in the middle of a chapter or at the end of the chapter what percentage of the kind they think a particular predicate applies to (for instance, what percentage of elephants do you think live in Africa?).

Prevalence Estimates per Participant
------------------------------------

Histogram of all of a single participant's prevalence estimates, collapsed across trials and color coded for the number of correct responses on the memory check. - fill = number of correct responses on the memory check (out of 10) - facet = particiapnts

![](elephants-1-pilot_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

Filler Trials
-------------

For all subsequent analyses, we will only consider participants who answered 7 or more items correctly in the statement identification task. (n = 23 out of 27)

In filler trials, participants read a chapter about a novel kind similar to the critical trials. They are then asked to estimate the prevalence of a property in the kind. Two of the filler trials used quantifiers (and thus we have strong idea about literal meaning)

-   "all aliens love Zorxon"
-   "no storms (or few) on Dax result in permanent damage..."

other two are generics about singular properties

![](elephants-1-pilot_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

Critical Trials (collapsed across item)
---------------------------------------

Participants answered questions of the form "What percentage of elephants do you think live in Africa?" in both conditions. The x-axis shows the prevalence estimates.
