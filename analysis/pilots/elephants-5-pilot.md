Attention check
---------------

### Slider practice

Before the experiment, participants practice usign the sliders to rate 3 category--property pairs:

-   dogs bark (coded as correct if x &gt; 0.5)
-   birds are male (coded as correct if 0.25 &lt; x &lt; 0.75)
-   cats get cancer (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.75) \[being generous with this one\]
-   lions lay eggs (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.10)

|  n\_correct|    n|
|-----------:|----:|
|           2|    2|
|           4|   25|

| property        |  n\_correct|
|:----------------|-----------:|
| birds are male  |          26|
| cats get cancer |          27|
| dogs bark       |          26|
| lions lay eggs  |          25|

### Memory check

After the story, participants select statements they recall learning from a list of 10 generic statements about novel animals (5 true, 5 distractor). They are also asked to explain what they did in the experiment.
Note: for this pilot, memory checks were mistakenly asked even though the participant did not see the corresponding chapter. This was resolved for future experiments, beginning at elephants-6.

### Prevalence Estimates per Participant

Histogram of all of a single participant's prevalence estimates, collapsed across trials and color coded for the number of correct responses on the memory check.
- fill = number of correct responses on the memory check (out of 10)
- facet = participants

### Bootstrapped 95% Confidence Intervals for Relationships Between Prevalence Estimates (collapsed across items)

The relationships between prevalence estimates of the mentioned property (property 1) and the other property (property 2) could be: - mutually exclusive: both properties cannot occur at the same time, so the sum of prevalence estimates cannot exceed 1
- prevalence for property 1 is greater than property 2
- property 1 is interpreted as a universal
- property 2 is interpreted as a universal
\* These conditions are not mutually exclusive; a participant can fall into one or more of the categories for a given trial.
