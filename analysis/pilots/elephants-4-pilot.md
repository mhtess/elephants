Attention Checks
----------------

### Slider Practice

Before the experiment, participants practice using the sliders to rate 3 category-property pairs:

-   dogs bark (coded as correct if x &gt; 0.5)
-   birds are male (coded as correct if 0.25 &lt; x &lt; 0.75)
-   cats get cancer (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.75) \[being generous with this one\]
-   lions lay eggs (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.10)

|  n\_correct|    n|
|-----------:|----:|
|           3|    3|
|           4|   33|

| property        |  n\_correct|
|:----------------|-----------:|
| birds are male  |          36|
| cats get cancer |          36|
| dogs bark       |          36|
| lions lay eggs  |          33|

### Memory Check

After the story, participants select statements they recall learning from a list of 10 generic statements about novel animals (5 true, 5 distractor).

### Explanations of Task

After the story, participants are also asked to explain generally what they did in the experiment.
