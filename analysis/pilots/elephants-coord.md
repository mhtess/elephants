## Attention Checks

### Slider Practice

Before the experiment, participants practice using the sliders to rate 3
category-property pairs:

  - dogs bark (coded as correct if x \> 0.5)
  - birds are male (coded as correct if 0.25 \< x \< 0.75)
  - cats get cancer (coded as correct if x \< 0.75) \[being generous
    with this one\]
  - lions lay eggs (coded as correct if x \< 0.10)

| n\_correct |  n |
| ---------: | -: |
|          1 |  1 |
|          2 |  8 |
|          3 | 10 |
|          4 | 44 |

| property        | n\_correct |
| :-------------- | ---------: |
| birds are male  |         58 |
| cats get cancer |         59 |
| dogs bark       |         60 |
| lions lay eggs  |         46 |

### Memory Check

After the story, participants select statements they recall learning
from a list of 10 generic statements about novel animals (5 true, 5
distractor). They are also asked to explain what they did in the
experiment.

they did in the
experiment.

Histogram of all of a single participant’s prevalence estimates,
collapsed across trials and color coded for the number of correct
responses on the memory check. \* fill = number of correct responses on
the memory check (out of 10) \* facet = participants
