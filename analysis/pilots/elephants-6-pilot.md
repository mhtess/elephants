### Slider practice

Before the experiment, participants practice using the sliders to rate 3 category-property pairs: - dogs bark (coded as correct if x &gt; 0.5) - birds are male (coded as correct if 0.25 &lt; x &lt; 0.75) - cats get cancer (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.75) \[being generous with this one\] - lions lay eggs (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.10)

|  n\_correct|    n|
|-----------:|----:|
|           3|    1|
|           4|   26|

| property        |  n\_correct|
|:----------------|-----------:|
| birds are male  |          27|
| cats get cancer |          27|
| dogs bark       |          27|
| lions lay eggs  |          26|

### Memory check

After the story, participants select statements they recall learning from a list of 10 generic statements about novel animals (5 true, 5 distractor).

### Explanations of task

After the story, participants are also asked to explain generally what they did in the experiment.

Removing participants who got fewer than 7 correct on memory check and didn't get all 4 sliders. (Participants with bad explanations usually fell into one of these other groups.)

Prevalence Estimates per Participant
------------------------------------

Histogram of all of a single participant's prevalence estimates, collapsed across trials and color coded for the number of correct responses on the memory check.
- fill = number of correct responses on the memory check (out of 10)
- facet = participants

Filler Trials
-------------

These used quantifiers (and thus we have strong idea about literal meaning).

Critical Trials (collapsed across item)
---------------------------------------

*Conditions*

1.  AF: "Elephants live in Africa" -- Q(Africa, Asia) -- "and breathe oxygen"
2.  AF&: "Elephants live in Africa and" -- Q(Africa, Asia) -- "breathe oxygen"
3.  AF&AS: "Elephants live in Africa and Asia" -- Q(Africa, Asia) -- "while alive"

### Bootstrapped 95% Confidence Intervals (collapsed across item)

*Property 2* = "% live in Asia" for ME trials and "% eat bugs" for NME trials

### Bootstrapped 95% Confidence Intervals for Relationships Between Prevalence Estimates (collapsed across items)

The relationships between prevalence estimates of the mentioned property (property 1) and the other property (property 2) could be: - mutually exclusive: both properties cannot occur at the same time, so the sum of prevalence estimates cannot exceed 1
- prevalence for property 1 is greater than property 2
- property 1 is interpreted as a universal
- property 2 is interpreted as a universal
\* These conditions are not mutually exclusive; a participant can fall into one or more of the categories for a given trial.
