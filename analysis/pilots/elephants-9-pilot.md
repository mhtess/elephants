Attention Checks
----------------

### Slider Practice

Before the experiment, participants practice using the sliders to rate 3 sentences:

-   Anna laughed on Jon. (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.5)
-   The train from Edmonton to Orlando was late. (coded as correct if x &gt; 0.5)
-   The burning candle spelled wrong. (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.5)

Most participants judged the third sentence to be acceptable, so we don't exclude any participants who did so. ![](elephants-9-pilot_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

|  n\_correct|    n|
|-----------:|----:|
|           1|    2|
|           2|   27|
|           3|   79|

| sentence                          |  n\_correct|
|:----------------------------------|-----------:|
| Anna laughed on Jon.              |          81|
| The burning candle spelled wrong. |         108|
| The train was late this morning.  |         104|

### Memory Check

After the story, participants select statements they recall seeing from a list of 10 (5 true, 5 distractor).

### Explanations of Task

After the story, participants are also asked to explain generally what they did in the experiment.

### Acceptability Judgements by Participant

Histogram of all of a single participant's acceptability judgements, collapsed across trials and color coded for the number of correct responses on the memory check.
\* fill = number of correct responses on the memory check (out of 10)
\* facet = participants
