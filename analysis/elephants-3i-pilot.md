### Changes from Pilot 3

-   interrupted version of experiment 3 (some trials ask questions mid-chapter)

-   randomize order of trials with constraint that no 2 criticals back-to-back

Attention check
---------------

### Slider practice

Before the experiment, participants practice usign the sliders to rate 3 category--property pairs:

-   dogs bark (coded as correct if x &gt; 0.5)
-   birds are male (coded as correct if 0.25 &lt; x &lt; 0.75)
-   cats get cancer (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.75)
-   lions lay eggs (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.10)

### Memory check

After the story, participants select statements they recall learning from a list of 10 generic statements about novel animals (5 true, 5 distractor). They are also asked to explain what they did in the experiment.
