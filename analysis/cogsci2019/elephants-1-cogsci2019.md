Experiment 1 for CogSci 2019 (Elephants-3i)
-------------------------------------------

### Changes from Pilot 3

-   interrupted version of experiment 3 (some trials ask questions mid-chapter)
-   added trials where we ask about non-mutually exclusive properties (NME)
-   randomize order of trials with constraint that no 2 criticals back-to-back

| 96af15bc4569cd5de7268f3446d1c87b | English  | 1         | 34  | Male   | The question about he 4 claws vs sever claws was confusing to me. It stated that they had 4 and 7 claws then I had to use a slider to tell what percentage had 4 and what percentage had seven. To me, by the sound of having 4 and seven claws, it didn't sound like either or but that the creatures had 4 claws and 7 claws (perhaps at different parts of their bodies). That was my only confusion. |                                                                                                                                                 |

Attention Checks
----------------

### Slider Practice

Before the experiment, participants practice using the sliders to rate 3 category-property pairs:

-   dogs bark (coded as correct if x &gt; 0.5)
-   birds are male (coded as correct if 0.25 &lt; x &lt; 0.75)
-   cats get cancer (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.75) \[being generous with this one\]
-   lions lay eggs (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.10)

|  n\_correct|    n|
|-----------:|----:|
|           1|    2|
|           2|    4|
|           3|    9|
|           4|   39|

| property        |  n\_correct|
|:----------------|-----------:|
| birds are male  |          48|
| cats get cancer |          52|
| dogs bark       |          48|
| lions lay eggs  |          45|

### Memory Check

After the story, participants select statements they recall learning from a list of 10 generic statements about novel animals (5 true, 5 distractor). They are also asked to explain what they did in the experiment. ![](elephants-1-cogsci2019_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

### Exclusions

Subject 12 rated 66% cats get cancer, otherwise seems proficient. In other subjects, attention check mechanisms seem correlated.

Participants
------------

### Included/Excluded Subject Numbers

Removing participants who got fewer than 7 correct on memory check and didn't get all 4 sliders. (Participants with bad explanations usually fell into one of these other groups.)

| memory\_fail | slider\_fail |    n|
|:-------------|:-------------|----:|
| FALSE        | FALSE        |   32|
| FALSE        | TRUE         |    8|
| TRUE         | FALSE        |    8|
| TRUE         | TRUE         |    6|

### Prevalence Estimates by Participant

Histogram of all of a single participant's prevalence estimates, collapsed across trials and color coded for the number of correct responses on the memory check. \* fill = number of correct responses on the memory check (out of 10) \* facet = participants

Filler Trials
-------------

These used quantifiers (and thus we have strong idea about literal meaning).

By-item Analyses
----------------

### Items

Items can be categorized by the continuation type and the coordination type.

-   continuation type: the interrupted sentence containing the questioned properties varies according to how real the subject matter is.
    -   real: Sentence and properties are completely real.
    -   fakeNames: The properties concern real items (like religion), but the name is made-up (Daith).
    -   fakeDefs: The properties concern completely made-up items.
-   coordination type: the "and" conjoins different syntactic categories

| coordination | continuationType |    n|
|:-------------|:-----------------|----:|
| np           | fakeDefs         |    2|
| np           | fakeNames        |    2|
| np           | real             |    5|
| pp           | fakeDefs         |    3|
| pp           | fakeNames        |    1|
| pp           | real             |    2|
