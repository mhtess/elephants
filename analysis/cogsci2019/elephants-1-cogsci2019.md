|         1| English  | 0         | 27  | Female | On an early question (question 4, maybe?) there was one property that said  during the question instead of a property to consider. I marked % for this question. | I don&quotechart know if it was intentional, or part of the experiment, but reading the stories in segments as they were presented, with such large letters, made them kind of difficult to parse? Having the whole story on one page would have helped my memory of the facts better, I think. But again: maybe that was part of the experiment. :) |

Attention Checks
----------------

### Slider Practice

Before the experiment, participants practice using the sliders to rate 3 category-property pairs:

-   dogs bark (coded as correct if x &gt; 0.5)
-   birds are male (coded as correct if 0.25 &lt; x &lt; 0.75)
-   cats get cancer (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.75) \[being generous with this one\]
-   lions lay eggs (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.10)

| property        |  sum(correct)|
|:----------------|-------------:|
| birds are male  |            26|
| cats get cancer |            25|
| dogs bark       |            27|
| lions lay eggs  |            24|

|  n\_correct|    n|
|-----------:|----:|
|           1|    1|
|           2|    1|
|           3|    1|
|           4|   24|

### Memory check

After the story, participants select statements they recall learning from a list of 10 generic statements about novel animals (5 true, 5 distractor). They are also asked to explain what they did in the experiment.

|        25| I selected my percentage to certain events happening in the chapters that related to the story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|        26| I am not a person who does well learning mundane facts that have little meaning or future use. Never have in school and even now i&quotecharve forgotten everything. Its hard to relate to thing that don&quotechart have an image and simply stating something has wings or something, it doesn&quotechart really associate the names to anything that sits in my working memory. |

Participants

### Included/Excluded Subject Numbers

Removing participants who got fewer than 7 correct on memory check and didn't get all 4 sliders. (Participants with bad explanations usually fell into one of these other groups.)

| memory\_fail | slider\_fail |    n|
|:-------------|:-------------|----:|
| FALSE        | FALSE        |   19|
| FALSE        | TRUE         |    2|
| TRUE         | FALSE        |    5|
| TRUE         | TRUE         |    1|

### Prevalence Estimates by Participant

Histogram of all of a single participant's prevalence estimates, collapsed across trials and color coded for the number of correct responses on the memory check. \* fill = number of correct responses on the memory check (out of 10) \* facet = participants

Filler Trials
-------------

These used quantifiers (and thus we have strong idea about literal meaning).

By-item Analyses

### Items

Items can be categorized by the continuation type and the coordination type.

-   continuation type: the interrupted sentence containing the questioned properties varies according to how real the subject matter is.
    -   real: Sentence and properties are completely real.
    -   fakeNames: The properties concern real items (like religion), but the name is made-up (Daith).
    -   fakeDefs: The properties concern completely made-up items.
-   coordination type: the "and" conjoins different syntactic categories

| coordination | continuationType |    n|
|:-------------|:-----------------|----:|
| np           | fakeDefs         |    2|
| np           | fakeNames        |    2|
| np           | real             |    5|
| pp           | fakeDefs         |    3|
| pp           | fakeNames        |    1|
| pp           | real             |    2|
