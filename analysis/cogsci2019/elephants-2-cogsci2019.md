Experiment 2 for CogSci 2019 (Elephants-7)
------------------------------------------

-   revert to stims that don't mention both properties
-   ask about % in some other group (e.g. What % of elephants live on some other continent?)

All questions interrupting.

-   int1: (Africa) -- Q(Af, As) -- (and eat bugs in the wild)
-   int2: (Africa and) -- Q(Af, As) -- (eat bugs in the wild)
-   int4: (Africa and Asia) -- Q(Af, As) -- (which is warm)

Attention Checks
----------------

### Slider Practice

Before the experiment, participants practice using the sliders to rate 3 category-property pairs:

-   dogs bark (coded as correct if x &gt; 0.5)
-   birds are male (coded as correct if 0.25 &lt; x &lt; 0.75)
-   cats get cancer (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.75) \[being generous with this one\]
-   lions lay eggs (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.10)

|  n\_correct|    n|
|-----------:|----:|
|           1|    1|
|           2|    2|
|           3|    2|
|           4|   22|

| property        |  n\_correct|
|:----------------|-----------:|
| birds are male  |          25|
| cats get cancer |          25|
| dogs bark       |          27|
| lions lay eggs  |          22|

### Memory Check

After the story, participants select statements they recall learning from a list of 10 generic statements about novel animals (5 true, 5 distractor). They are also asked to explain what they did in the experiment.

### Explanations of Task

After the story, participants are also asked to explain generally what they did in the experiment.

### Included/Excluded Subject Numbers

Removing participants who got fewer than 7 correct on memory check and didn't get all 4 sliders. (Participants with bad explanations usually fell into one of these other groups.)

| memory\_fail | slider\_fail |    n|
|:-------------|:-------------|----:|
| FALSE        | FALSE        |   20|
| FALSE        | TRUE         |    2|
| TRUE         | FALSE        |    2|
| TRUE         | TRUE         |    3|

### Prevalence Estimates by Participant

Histogram of all of a single participant's prevalence estimates, collapsed across trials and color coded for the number of correct responses on the memory check.
\* fill = number of correct responses on the memory check (out of 10)
\* facet = participants

Filler Trials

These used quantifiers (and thus we have strong idea about literal meaning).

### Bootstrapped 95% Confidence Intervals for Relationships Between Prevalence Estimates (collapsed across items)

The relationships between prevalence estimates of the mentioned property (property 1) and the other property (property 2) could be: - mutually exclusive: both properties cannot occur at the same time, so the sum of prevalence estimates cannot exceed 1
- prevalence for property 1 is greater than property 2
- property 1 is interpreted as a universal
- property 2 is interpreted as a universal
\* These conditions are not mutually exclusive; a participant can fall into one or more of the categories for a given trial.
