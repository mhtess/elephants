All questions interrupting.

Attention Checks
----------------

### Slider Practice

Before the experiment, participants practice using the sliders to rate 3 category-property pairs:

-   dogs bark (coded as correct if x &gt; 0.5)
-   birds are male (coded as correct if 0.25 &lt; x &lt; 0.75)
-   cats get cancer (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.75) \[being generous with this one\]
-   lions lay eggs (coded as correct if x &lt; 0.10)

|  n\_correct|    n|
|-----------:|----:|
|           1|    1|
|           2|    6|
|           3|   12|
|           4|   89|

| property        |  n\_correct|
|:----------------|-----------:|
| birds are male  |         102|
| cats get cancer |         105|
| dogs bark       |         103|
| lions lay eggs  |          95|

### Memory Check

After the story, participants select statements they recall learning from a list of 10 generic statements about novel animals (5 true, 5 distractor). They are also asked to explain what they did in the experiment.

### Bootstrapped 95% Confidence Intervals for Relationships Between Prevalence Estimates (collapsed across items)

The relationships between prevalence estimates of the mentioned property (property 1) and the other property (property 2) could be: - mutually exclusive: both properties cannot occur at the same time, so the sum of prevalence estimates cannot exceed 1
- prevalence for property 1 is greater than property 2
- property 1 is interpreted as a universal
- property 2 is interpreted as a universal
\* These conditions are not mutually exclusive; a participant can fall into one or more of the categories for a given trial.

By-item Analyses
----------------

### Items

Items can be categorized by the continuation type and the coordination type.

-   continuation type: the interrupted sentence containing the questioned properties varies according to how real the subject matter is.
    -   real: Sentence and properties are completely real.
    -   fakeNames: The properties concern real items (like religion), but the name is made-up (Daith).
    -   fakeDefs: The properties concern completely made-up items.
-   coordination type: the "and" conjoins different syntactic categories

| coordination | continuationType |    n|
|:-------------|:-----------------|----:|
| ap           | real             |    1|
| np           | fakeDefs         |    8|
| np           | real             |    1|
| pp           | fakeNames        |    1|
| pp           | real             |    2|
