## Attention check

### Slider practice

Before the experiment, participants practice usign the sliders to rate 3
category–property pairs:

  - dogs bark (coded as correct if x \> 0.5)
  - birds are male (coded as correct if 0.25 \< x \< 0.75)
  - ticks carry lyme disease (coded as correct if x \< 0.50)

Several (9) participants rated % of ticks with Lyme disease as \> 50%
(but got other two slider questions correct). Not excluding anyone using
this metric.

### Memory check

After the story, participants select statements they recall learning
from a list of 10 generic statements about novel animals (5 true, 5
distractor). They are also asked to explain what they did in the
experiment.

|       15 | I read chapters on a planet and it gave details and facts on how the aliens live on that planet and we was asked our opinion on each section.                                                                                                     |

|       18 | I read a story about an alien planet and answered questions during the reading.                                                                                                                                                                   |
|       19 | I was making estimates based on the information that I read. I tried my best to recall the facts above as well but my memory isn\&quotechart too great and at times I can forget the information the second I turn the page, I hope this is okay. |
|       20 | I provided ratings of certain characteristics to the aliens and creatures living on the planet.                                                                                                                                                   |
|       21 | I read a short book about the planet that described its various animals and plants.                                                                                                                                                               |
|       22 | I read Chapters and selected what percentage of a certain thing did something.                                                                                                                                                                    |
|       23 | I read a sentence with unfamiliar words/names for creatures and tried to determine whether the sentence was saying ALL creatures did this or SOME, or NONE.                                                                                       |
|       24 | I estimate the existence situation percentage.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Trial data

Removing participants who got fewer than 7 correct on memory check.

## participant responses

collapsed across trials

  - fill = number of correct responses on the memory check (out of 10)
  - facet = particiapnts

## filler trials

these used quantifiers (and thus we have strong idea about literal
meaning)

  - “no Xs are poisonous to lorches”
  - “some build permanent structures”
  - “all have hollow bones”
  - “all aliens love Zorxon”
  - “no storms (or few) on Dax result in permanent damage…”
