# Conjunctive generics experiments

## Incremental interpretation experiments

1. Elephants-1
- n = 27 ($0.75)
- fixed order of chapters, random assignment of condition (interrupted vs. completed) to chapter
- [experiment on web](http://www.mit.edu/~tessler/projects/elephants/experiments/elephants-1.html)

2. Elephants-2
- n = 27 ($0.85)
- added practice trials with sliders (dogs -- bark, birds -- male, ticks -- lyme disease)
- 15 trials: 10 critical, 5 fillers (no conjunction, quantifiers)
- 10 critical trials: 5 conjunction relevant, 5 conjunction irrelevant (within item randomization)
- randomize order of chapters
- [experiment on web](http://www.mit.edu/~tessler/projects/elephants/experiments/elephants-2.html)

3. Elephants-3
- change "ticks carry lyme disease" to get "cats get cancer", add "lions lay eggs"
- enrich chapter to provide more context for the mutual exclusivity
- add items
- ask about both properties
- memory check to test actually tested properties
- [experiment on web](http://www.mit.edu/~tessler/projects/elephants/experiments/elephants-3.html) [might be outdated]

4. Elephants-3i
- interrupted version of experiment 3 (some trials ask questions mid-chapter)
- added trials where we ask about non-mutually exclusive properties
- randomize order of trials with constraint that no 2 criticals back-to-back
- [experiment on web](http://www.mit.edu/~tessler/projects/elephants/experiments/elephants-3.html)

5. Elephants-4
- add ability to interrupt chapter at other locations
- conditions
  - int1: Elephants live in Africa... Q(Africa, Asia)
  - int2: Elephants live in Africa and... Q(Africa, Asia)
  - int3: Elephants live in Africa and eat bugs... Q(Africa, Asia)
  - int4: Elephants live in Africa and Asia... Q(Africa, Asia)

6. Elephants-5
- add page number
- for critical trials, add ability to break sentence before or after conjunction (no interrupting question)
- for filler trials, add conjunctive generic that is split next to the conjunction (recorded in conjunctionBreak), question still asks about quantified predicates

7. Elephants-6
- mention both predicates that are asked about on the question slide through additional information at the beginning of each chapter

8. Elephants-7
- ($1.25)
- question about %Africa/%other continent instead of %Africa/%Asia
- adjust spacing so that all pages have 3 lines or less

9. Elephants-8
- n = 18 per condition, N = 54 ($1.25) (02/21/2019)
- n = 18 per condition, N = 54 ($1.25) (02/23/2019)
- 21 trials per subject
  - first chapter
  - 2 filler chapters
  - 4 uninterrupted critical chapters
  - 4 interrupted critical chapters
  - 2 uninterrupted NME chapters
  - 2 interrupted NME chapters
  - 3 uninterrupted fillers
  - 3 interrupted fillers
  - no two back-to-back critical chapters
- same conditions as Elephants-3i, but using stimuli from Elephants-7, adjusted as follows:
  - all filler trials have page breaks before and
  - all predicates in critical trials are vp-coordinated
- between subject condition: generic/most/all quantified sentences in critical trials

10. Elephants-9: acceptability judgements on natural mutually exclusive items
Results from Elephants-3 may be confounded due to the availability of a group predicate interpretation under NP-coordination. We want to show that VP-coordination doesn't allow a group predicate interpretation using acceptability judgements with quantified statements. (All elephants live in Africa and live in Asia should be unacceptable, while Elephants live in Africa and live in Asia should be acceptable, e.g.)
- between-subjects: NP vs. VP coordination
- within-subjects: most vs. all vs. generic
- practice trials: grammatical but unacceptable sentences
- sliding scale
- memory check with NP vs. VP coordinated distractors
- each subject does each item (30 trials total)
- n = 54; $1.00 
stim types:
- weather: 2
- animals: 10
- plants: 1
- food: 7
- artifacts: 5
- people: 3
