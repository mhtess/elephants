# Conjunctive generics experiments

## Incremental interpretation experiments

1. Elephants-1
- n = 27 ($0.75)
- fixed order of chapters, random assignment of condition (interrupted vs. completed) to chapter
- [experiment on web](http://www.mit.edu/~tessler/projects/elephants/experiments/elephants-1.html)

2. Elephants-2
- n = 27 ($0.85)
- added practice trials with sliders (dogs -- bark, birds -- male, ticks -- lyme disease)
- 15 trials: 10 critical, 5 fillers (no conjunction, quantifiers)
- 10 critical trials: 5 conjunction relevant, 5 conjunction irrelevant (within item randomization)
- randomize order of chapters
- [experiment on web](http://www.mit.edu/~tessler/projects/elephants/experiments/elephants-2.html)

2. Elephants-3
- change "ticks carry lyme disease" to get "cats get cancer"
- enrich chapter to provide more context for the mutual exclusivity
- ask about both properties
