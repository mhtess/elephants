# Conjunctive generics experiments

## Incremental interpretation experiments

1. Elephants-1
- n = 27 ($0.75)
- fixed order of chapters, random assignment of condition (interrupted vs. completed) to chapter
- [experiment on web](http://www.mit.edu/~tessler/projects/elephants/experiments/elephants-1.html)

2. Elephants-2
- n = 27 ($0.85)
- added practice trials with sliders (dogs -- bark, birds -- male, ticks -- lyme disease)
- 15 trials: 10 critical, 5 fillers (no conjunction, quantifiers)
- 10 critical trials: 5 conjunction relevant, 5 conjunction irrelevant (within item randomization)
- randomize order of chapters
- [experiment on web](http://www.mit.edu/~tessler/projects/elephants/experiments/elephants-2.html)

3. Elephants-3
- change "ticks carry lyme disease" to get "cats get cancer", add "lions lay eggs"
- enrich chapter to provide more context for the mutual exclusivity
- add items
- ask about both properties
- memory check to test actually tested properties
- [experiment on web](http://www.mit.edu/~tessler/projects/elephants/experiments/elephants-3.html) [might be outdated]

4. Elephants-3i
- interrupted version of experiment 3 (some trials ask questions mid-chapter)
- added trials where we ask about non-mutually exclusive properties
- randomize order of trials with constraint that no 2 criticals back-to-back
- [experiment on web](http://www.mit.edu/~tessler/projects/elephants/experiments/elephants-3.html)

5. Elephants-4
- first pass at varying breaks expt ("Africa", "Africa and", "Africa and Asia")

6. Elephants-5

- change critical stimuli to introduce both properties
- add conjunctive generic fillers about ME properties

7. Elephants-6

- make conjunctive generic fillers about NME properties

8. Elephants-7

- revert to stims-4 for critical trials
- ask about Africa and "other place"?
- add instructions telling them not to worry about remembering everything
