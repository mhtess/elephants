# Experiments

## elephants-storybook-both
- n = 27, n = 27 (05/18/2019) and n = 27 (05/19/2019)
- First n = 27 is Experiment 1 reported in CogSci 2019.
- Participants see conjunctive generics with either a mutually exclusive (ME) or non-mutually exclusive (NME) continuation. The generic is either interrupted before "and" or uninterrupted. (4 conditions total).
- Participants are asked to rate what % of kind has predicate1 and what % of kind has predicate2 (either ME or NME). (both questions)
- Each participant contributes 12 critical observations across all 4 conditions.
- There are 8 filler trials.
- $1.50

## elephants-storybook-single
- n = 27 (09/06/2019), n = 27 (03/20/2020)
- First n = 27 reported in CUNY 2020.
- Modifies `elephants-storybook-both` to ask only about what % of kind has predicate1. (single question).
- $1.50

## elephants-incremental-both
- n = 108, n = 359 (11/15/2019)
- First n = 108 is Experiment 2 reported in CogSci 2019.
- Modifies `elephants-storybook-both` to ask about %Africa/%other continent instead of %Africa/%Asia to avoid explicitly mentioning the continuing predicate
- $1.25

## elephants-storybook-quantifiers
- n = 54 (02/21/2019), n = 54 (02/23/2019)
- 21 trials per subject
  - first chapter
  - 2 filler chapters
  - 4 uninterrupted critical chapters
  - 4 interrupted critical chapters
  - 2 uninterrupted NME chapters
  - 2 interrupted NME chapters
  - 3 uninterrupted fillers
  - 3 interrupted fillers
  - no two back-to-back critical chapters
- same conditions as Elephants-3i, but using stimuli from Elephants-7, adjusted as follows:
  - all filler trials have page breaks before and
  - all predicates in critical trials are vp-coordinated
- between subject condition: generic/most/all quantified sentences in critical trial
- Participants are evenly distributed between conditions.
- $1.25

## elephants-acceptability: acceptability judgements on natural mutually exclusive items
Results from Elephants-3 may be confounded due to the availability of a group predicate interpretation under NP-coordination. We want to show that VP-coordination doesn't allow a group predicate interpretation using acceptability judgements with quantified statements. (All elephants live in Africa and live in Asia should be unacceptable, while Elephants live in Africa and live in Asia should be acceptable, e.g.)
- between-subjects: NP vs. VP coordination
- within-subjects: most vs. all vs. generic
- practice trials: grammatical but unacceptable sentences
- sliding scale
- memory check with NP vs. VP coordinated distractors-
- each subject does each item (30 trials total)
- n = 54; $1.00
stim types:
- weather: 2
- animals: 10
- plants: 1
- food: 7
- artifacts: 5
- people: 5

## elephants-tvjt: truth value judgement task version of elephants-acceptability
truth version of task (elephants-9-truth: n = 54 (N=108); $1.00 (05/08/2019)

## elephants-me
- n = 36 (05/19/2019)
- Attempts to obtain a measure of the strength of mutual exclusivity for each item.
- same story as in elephants-3, without last sentence, ask explicitly about the following probabilities: Pr(Africa), Pr(Asia | Africa), Pr(eat bugs | Africa)
- 15 trials per subject
- $1

## elephants-samescreen-single
- n = 27 (04/11/2020)
- Modifies `elephants-storybook-single` so that all information and question presented on same page
- $1.50

## elephants-coord
- n = 63 (04/14/2020)
- $1.50
- Modifies `elephants-samescreen-single` to vary the coordination level of the critical sentences into four conditions: S, VP, NP, PP.
- Coordination level is manipulated within subjects.
