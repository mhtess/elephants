\section{Introduction}

Extending an analysis of generics to handle complex-predicates poses unique challenges.
A sentence of the form ``Ks F and G'' introduces an ambiguity:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\denote{gen}(K) [F \land G]$
\item $\denote{gen}(K) [F] \land \denote{gen}(K) [G]$
\end{enumerate}

Consider the following examples:

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item Triangles have three sides and three angles.
\item Ravens have two wings and two legs.
\item Elephants live in Africa and Asia.
\item Lions have manes and give live birth.
\end{enumerate}

It is conceivable that both (1) and (2) can be analyzed in terms of a (context-sensitive) generic operator acting on a logically complex predicates (i.e., \emph{all triangles both have three sides and three angles}, \emph{most ravens have two wings and two legs}). 
Individual elephants do not migrate across continents and thus live in both Africa and Asia. 
The individual lions that have manes are a distinct sub-category from those that give live birth (i.e., the properties pick out the males and the females, respectively). 
The logically complex predicates in sentences (3) and (4), thus, are not true generically of their associated categories; rather, the sentences should be understood as a conjunction of generic sentences.

\section{Computational Model}


\section{Experiment}

\subsection{Methods}

\subsection{Participants}
We recruited N participants through Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
Participants were restricted to those with verified U.S. IP addresses and had at least a 95\% work approval rating. 

\subsection{Procedure}
Participants were told they would be reading a storybook and be asked questions at the end of each chapter. 
Questions were all of the same type, an \emph{implied prevalence} question \cite{Gelman2003, Cimpian2010} that read: ``Out of all Ks, what percentage do you think F?'', where K represents a category and F a feature. 
Responses were recorded using a 101-pt slider bar with end-points labeled 0\% and 100\%, and with the exact value appearing dynamically above the slider. 
Participants were familiarized with the response variable in a practice trial, where they were asked to report how many dogs bark, birds are male, and ticks carry lyme disease. 
We used these questions to encourage participants to use the full range of the response scale. 

Following this instructions / familiarization period, participants read a storybook consisting of 16 paragraphs we refer to as \emph{chapters} (items), each of which spanned 2 - 4 screens of text which spanned 2 - 4 lines on the screen. 
At the end of all but the first chapter, participants answered an implied prevalence question relating to a sentence in the preceding chapter. 
At the end of the storybook, participants completed a memory check question where they had to select all the facts they had learned in the story from a list of 10 (5 real, 5 distractor); in addition, participants were asked to explain what the experiment was about in very general terms.

We used 10 critical chapters (items), each which could be assigned to one of two experimental conditions.
A given chapter in the two experimental conditions differed only in the information present on the final screen of a chapter.
The penultimate screen of all critical trials ended with the beginning of a conjunctive sentence that was broken up immediately before the ``and'' in the sentence \red{(Figure); e.g., ``They ascribe to the Caboo religion'')}. 
Text on the page was fully-justified so that the final word on a page always appeared in the bottom-right corner of the screen, giving the appearance that the page naturally ended at that word.
In the \emph{relevant conjunction} condition, the continuation of the sentence (final screen) was a property that was anti-correlated (or, somewhat mutually exclusive) with the property on the preceding page (e.g., ``and the Daith religion''). 
In the \emph{irrelevant conjunction} condition, the continuation was a property that was unrelated to the property on the preceding page (e.g., ``...and follow a strict code of laws.''). 
In addition, we had 5 filler trials which appeared similar to the \emph{irrelevant conjunction} cases.

\subsection{Materials}

The storybook was concerned with aliens and animals on a far-away planet and read like a children's book without any narrative (each chapter concerned non-interactiving categories and characters).
The text of a chapter mostly composed of generic sentences about novel categories (e.g., ``Glippets are intelligent creatures''), though some sentences mentioned specific fictional characters (``Wint lived a long time ago in the mountains.'').

Each chapter of the storybook was on
